This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.
==========================================================================================

- Well over 2k commits since 2.0.0

The Big Ones:

- Add new automatic perspective correction module (https://www.darktable.org/2016/03/a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction/)
- Liquify tool for all your fancy pixel moving (https://www.darktable.org/2016/04/liquify-liquify/)
- A new image module to use a Color Look Up Table (CLUT) to change colors in the image (https://www.darktable.org/2016/05/colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module/)
- A new tool, darktable-chart, that goes along with the CLUT module, to create styles for the latter
- Exposure fusion in the basecurve module to lower the dynamic range of images (https://www.darktable.org/2016/08/compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion/)
- Add new raw overexposure indication (https://www.darktable.org/2016/10/raw-overexposed/)
- Add undo/redo support for the darkroom

Quite Interesting Changes:

- Split the database into a library containing images and a general one with styles, presets and tags. That allows having access to those when for example running with a :memory: library
- Support running on platforms other than x86 (https://www.darktable.org/2016/04/running-on-non-x86-platforms/)
- Allow darktable-cli to work on folders
- Allow to import/export tags from Lightroom keyword files
- Allow using the cursor keys to interact with sliders, comboboxen and curves
- Support presets in "more modules" so you can quickly switch between your favorite sets of modules shown in the GUI
- Add range opertor and date compare to the collection module
- Support the Exif date and time when importing photos from camera
- CMYG and RGBE support
- Nicer web gallery exporter -- now touch friendly!
- OpenCL implementation of VNG/VNG4 demosaicing methods
- OpenCL implementation of Markesteijn demosaicing method for X-Trans sensors

Some More Changes, Probably Not Complete:

- Remove gnome keyring password backend, use libsecret instead
- When using libsecret to store passwords then put them into the correct collection
- Hint via window manager when import/export is done
- Quick tagging searches anywhere, not just at the start of tags
- darktable is now happy to use smaller stack sizes. That should allow using musl libc
- The sidecar XMP schema for history entries is now more consistent and less error prone
- Give the choice of equidistant and proportional feathering when using elliptical masks
- Add geolocation to watermark variables
- Support greyscale color profiles
- OSX: add trash support (thanks to Michael Kefeder for initial patch)
- Attach Xmp data to EXR files
- Several fixes for HighDPI displays
- Use Pango for text layout, thus supporting RTL languages
- Many bugs got fixed and some memory leaks plugged
- The usermanual was updated to reflect the changes in the 2.2 series

Changed Dependencies:

- In order to compile darktable you now need at least gcc-4.7+/clang-3.3+, but better use gcc-5.0+
- Drop support for OS X 10.6
- Bump required libexiv2 version up to 0.24
- Bump GTK+ requirement to gtk-3.14. (because even debian stable has it)
- Port to OpenJPEG2
