  <para>
    The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a film roll&nbsp;&ndash; a
    kind of virtual folder. Whenever you import images from disk, the images are organized in a
    film roll whose name is derived from the name of the disk folder. Re-importing a disk folder
    will add any new images to the existing film roll; images already present in the film roll
    are not touched.

  <para>
    It is important to note that importing images in darktable does not involve a physical copy
    step. Importing a folder into darktable is therefore <emphasis>not</emphasis> a backup
    operation of that folder.
