  <para>
    darktable offers a versatile feature to organize your images according to various user
    defined selection criteria. A set of images which is defined by a specific combination of
    selection criteria is called a collection. The most basic kind of collection is a film roll
    &nbsp;&ndash; covering all the images which have been imported from a specific folder on
    disk.
  </para>

  <para>
    You can easily construct other kinds of collections based on various image attributes like
    Exif data, filename, tags etc. Multiple criteria can be logically combined to narrow or
    extend your collection (see <xref linkend="collect_images"/>).
  </para>

  <para>
    darktable keeps a list of the most recently used collections for quick access (see
    <xref linkend="recently_used_collections"/>).
