  <title>temporarily switch off mask</title>
  <body>
    <p>Sometimes it is useful to visualize the module's effect without the mask taking action. You can do so by clicking on the 
    <image align="center" href="../images/darkroom_module_icon_eye.png" placement="inline" />symbol, which will temporarily deactivate the mask â€“ the selected blend mode and opacity remain in effect. Switch this button on and off to see if the mask is acting on the image as intended.</p>
