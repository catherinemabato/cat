  <title>output profile</title>
  <body>
    <p>Sets the color profile for output/export, causing darktable to render colors with this profile. darktable embeds the profile data into the output file if supported by the file format â€“ this allows other applications reading the file to correctly interpret its colors.</p>
    <p>As not all applications, e.g. image viewers, are aware of color profiles, a general recommendation is to stick to 
    <i>sRGB</i>as the default output profile. You should only deviate from 
    <i>sRGB</i>if this is really required and if you know what you are doing.</p>
