  <title>shadows color adjustment</title>
  <body>
    <p>This slider controls the color saturation adjustment made to shadows; high values cause saturation enhancements on lightened shadows; low values cause desaturation on lightened shadows. It is normally safe to leave this at its default of 100%. This gives a natural saturation boost on shadows â€“ similar to the one you would also expect in nature if shadows would receive more light.</p>
