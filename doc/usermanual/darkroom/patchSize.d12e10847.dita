  <title>patch size</title>
  <body>
    <p>This slider is only available if mode 
    <q>non-local means</q>is selected. It controls the size of the patches being matched when deciding which pixels to average (see also 
    <xref href="denoise_non_local_means.dita#denoise_non_local_means" type="topic">Denoise â€“ non local means</xref>). Set this to higher values as the noise gets higher. Beware that high values may smooth out small edges though. Processing time will stay about the same.</p>
