    <p>More functionality to control the interaction of multiple shapes within a mask can be found in the mask manager panel (see 
    <xref href="mask_manager.dita#mask_manager" type="topic">Mask manager</xref>). Here you can give individual names to your shapes which will help you to keep track of your shapes. You can also select individual shapes for editing â€“ a helpful feature if your masks happens to contain several shapes with overlapping control elements.</p>
