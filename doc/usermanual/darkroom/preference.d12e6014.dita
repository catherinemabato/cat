    <p>This combobox defines if certain replacement colors shall take precedence over others. In its default setting 
    <q>off</q>all pixels contribute equally. Setting it to 
    <q>saturated colors</q>makes pixels contribute according to their chromaticity â€“ the higher saturated a color the more it contributes. By selecting 
    <q>hue</q>you get a choice of giving precedence to a specific hue.</p>
