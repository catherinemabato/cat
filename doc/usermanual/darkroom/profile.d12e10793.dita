    <p>Based on Exif data of your raw file, darktable will automatically determine the camera model and ISO setting. If found in its database, the corresponding noise profile will be used. If your image has an intermediate ISO value, the statistical properties will be interpolated between the two closest datasets in the database, and this interpolated setting will show up as the first line in the combo box. You also have the option to manually overwrite this selection to suit your personal preferences better. The top-most entry in the combo box brings you back to the profile darktable deems most suited.</p>
