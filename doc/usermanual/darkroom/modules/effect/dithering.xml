	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>Dithering comes as one of the last steps in pixelpipe. In most cases Floyd-Steinberg will give best results. You need to take into account the desired output format in order to get
                      best effects.</para>

                <para>If you want to use dithering for exported images with a reduced width/height, please make sure that you de-activate option "do high quality resampling during export", else the
                      final scaling step will counteract dithering.</para>

                <para>Watching an image dithered into a low bit depth from a distance (e.g. "floyd-steinberg 1-bit b&amp;w") will give the impression of a homogeneous grayscale image.
                      In order to mimic this impression darktable dithers zoomed-out images in center view, navigation window and thumbnails into a higher number of grayscale levels. Please note that as 
                      a consequence the histogram - which is derived from the navigation window - will no longer be a full match of the output image.</para>

		<sect5><title>method</title>
			<para>This combobox sets the dithering method. Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion dithering with some typical output bit depths and random noise 
                        dithering are supported. Floyd-Steinberg systematically distributes quantization errors over neighboring pixels, whereas random dithering just adds some
                        level of randomness to "break" sharp tonal value bands. To eliminate banding on a typical 8-bit display, chose "floyd-steinberg 8-bit rgb".</para>

		<sect5><title>damping</title>
			<para>This slider is only displayed if you chose method "random". It controls the level of added random noise expressed as a damping factor in dB. A value
                              of -80dB is a good fit for 8-bit output formats.</para>
