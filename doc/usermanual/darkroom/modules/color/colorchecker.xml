            This module implements a generic color look up table in Lab space. The input is a
            list of source and target points, the complete mapping will be interpolated using splines.
            The resulting luts are editable by hand and can be created using the <code>darktable-chart</code>
            utility to match given input (such as hald-cluts and raw/jpg with in-camera processing pairs).

    <title>Usage</title>

      <title>color board</title>
      <para>
When you select the module in darkroom mode, it should look something like the
image above (configurations with more than 24 patches are shown in a 7x7 grid
instead).
By default, it will load the 24 patches of a colour checker classic
and initialise the mapping to identity (no change to the image).

The grid shows a list of coloured patches. The colours of the patches are
the source points.
The target colour of the selected patch is shown as
offset controlled by sliders in the ui under the grid of patches.
An outline is drawn around patches that have been altered, i.e. the source
and target colours differ.
The selected patch is marked with a white square, and the number shows
in the combo box below.

<title>interaction</title>
<para>
To interact with the colour mapping, you can change both source and target
colours. The main use case is to change the target colours however, and start
with an appropriate palette (see the presets menu, or download a style
somewhere).

You can change lightness (L), green-red (a), blue-yellow (b), or saturation
(C) of the target colour via sliders.
Select a patch by left clicking on it, or using the combo box, or using the
colour picker
to change source colour, select a new colour from your image by using the
colour picker, and shift-left-click on the patch you want to replace.
To reset a patch, double-click it.
Right-click a patch to delete it.
Shift-left-click on empty space to add a new patch (with the currently
picked colour as source colour).
