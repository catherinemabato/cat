  <title>spatial extent</title>
  <body>
    <p>Defines the spatial distance (x,y-coordinates) that source pixels may have from a target pixel in order for them to contribute to color replacement. Higher values cause ever more distant pixels to contribute; this increases the chance to find a replacement color but makes that color more undefined and less clear.</p>
