    <p>You leave edit mode by clicking on the 
    <image align="center" href="../images/shape_edit.png" placement="inline" />symbol. You can at any time go back to edit mode and do further adjustments by clicking the edit symbol again. In edit mode you can also remove a shape by right-clicking on it â€“ the shape is removed from the current mask but it's still in the list of defined shapes.</p>
    <p>Independent of the specific shape you can 
    <i>scroll</i>to change the size of the shape, 
    <i>shift+scroll</i>to change the feather of the shape and 
    <i>Ctrl+scroll</i>to change the opacity of the shape.</p>
    <p>If you 
    <i>Ctrl+click</i>on the edit mode symbol you enter a restricted edit mode. Certain actions like dragging a complete shape or changing its size are blocked. Only finetuning changes like dragging a node are allowed.</p>
    <p>Currently five shapes are implemented.</p>
