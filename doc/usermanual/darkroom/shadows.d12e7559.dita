    <p>Similar to the highlights parameter, this affects the other far end of the curve, and will increase or decrease contrast in the shadows. A higher value gives more contrast in the shadows. A lower value will lift the shadows and can effectively simulate a fill light. Note that this is done via local manipulation of the image, however: this means that a completely dark image cannot be brightened this way, only dark things in front of bright things will be affected.</p>
