    <p>This module reduces noise in your image but preserves sharp edges. This is accomplished by averaging pixels with their neighbors, taking into account not only the geometric distance but also the distance on the range scale, i.e. differences in the RGB values. As denoising is a resource hungry process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly; consider to activate this module late in your workflow. The module can be really effective if some RGB channel is more noisy than the 2 other channels. In such a case, use the channel mixer module to see the channels one by one, in order to set the blur intensities accordingly.</p>
