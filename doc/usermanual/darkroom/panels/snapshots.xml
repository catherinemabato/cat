            You can take snapshots of images as you process them. A snapshot is stored as a
            bitmap of the current center view and is kept as long as you stay in the darkroom. A
            snapshot can then be selected and overlaid in the current center view to help you
            with a side by side comparison (left: snapshot, right: active) when you are tuning
            parameters of a module. This can also be combined with history (see
            <xref linkend="history"/>) to compare the snapshot against different stages of
            development.

    You can control the split view by moving the splitline back and forth. If you hover with the
    mouse over the splitline, a small rotation icon will appear on the center of the line. Click
    it to change between vertical and horizontal split view.
