  <title>compression</title>

    <p>Compression is a percentage of total lightness range that is not affected by color toning. Default value is set to 33%; this is not the default behavior of an original split-toning which would be 0% compression. The choice of 33% as a default is to invite you experimenting with these parameters and how it extends the original split-toning method.</p>
