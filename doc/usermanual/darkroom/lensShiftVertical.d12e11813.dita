  <title>lens shift (vertical)</title>
  <body>
    <p>This parameter corrects converging lines vertically. In some cases you get a more naturally looking image if you correct vertical distortions not to their full extent but rather at an 80 to 90% level. If desired just reduce the value after having performed the automatic correction.</p>
