  <title>Lab lightness</title>
  <body>
    <p>Only available with modules that work in the Lab color space; this blend mode mixes lightness from the input and output images, while color data are taken unaltered from the input image. In contrast to blend mode 
    <q>lightness</q>this blend mode does not involve any color space conversion and does not clamp any data. In some cases this is less prone to artifacts in comparison to 
    <q>lightness</q>.</p>
