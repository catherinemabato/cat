    <p>This tool corrects the rotation angle helping you level an image. You can either set a numerical value or use your mouse directly on the image. To use your mouse, right-click, hold it down and draw a line along a suited horizontal or vertical feature; as soon as you release the mouse button the image is rotated so the line you drew matches the horizontal/vertical axis.</p>
