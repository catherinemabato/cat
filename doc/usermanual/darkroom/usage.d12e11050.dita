    <p>This module reduces noise in your image but preserves structures. This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the one pixel to be denoised. A patch with a certain size is used to measure that similarity. As denoising is a resource hungry process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly; consider activating this module late in your workflow.</p>
