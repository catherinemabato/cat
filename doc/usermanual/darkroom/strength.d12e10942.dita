    <p>This parameter is here to fine-tune the strength of the denoise effect. The default value has been chosen to maximize the peak signal to noise ratio. It's mostly a matter of taste if you prefer a rather low noise level at the costs of a higher loss of detail, or if you accept more remaining noise in order to have finer structures better preserved within your image.</p>
