    <p>When entering tethering view, a film roll will be created using the same structure as defined when you import from the camera. Job code will be predefined as 
    <q>capture</q>.</p>
    <p>If you want to group your captures into different film rolls, you should use the session panel in right side. When entering a new name and pressing enter, a new film roll will be created and captured images will go into this new film roll.</p>
    <p>darktable provides some nifty tools to setup a capture in the user interface. You can setup timelapse captures and brackets for HDR creations. The configuration is so dynamic that you can create sequential capture of brackets â€“ go figure... For more information read the documentation about the capture panel and the examples in this chapter.</p>
