0.8 release:

- check image support in cl implementation.

- processed maximum has to go to the cache in pixelpipe?
  - preview pipe still pink in high freq places:
  - edge aware gaussian downsampling?

- don't clear tag text on reset in tagging!

- import with lock contention?

- port to opencl:
  - bugfree atrous   (equiv to cpu)
  - exposure
  - highlights
  - white balance
  - base curve
  - sharpen (boundary on cpu?)

- try prophotorgb images as input for rendering intents.

- fedora packages, nightly:

- mandrivia:
ftp://bizdelnick.is-a-geek.net/pub/mandriva/2010.1/binary/x86_64/media/main/

- libraw: filters==0 fails.

mipf and full pipes:
- mipf just a sideproduct of full pipe?

- mipf black bug: race condition when mipf is written
  (see debug control.svg: preview process earlier as load raw?)

- remove bilateral filter (pemutohedral code), as it causes a lot
  of valgrind errors!

- ca auto corr on gpu in dt
- cache with gpu bufs, if possible
- avoid n-times compile for n gpu systems?

inconsistent borders:
tone curve
color correction
base curve

compress history stack: removes raw import settings.

big stuff:
 * auto rate feature (sharpness/colors/user statistics learning)
 * print view?
 * removable media, relocation and image sha1sums

 * devel docs about:
   . module interface, 3-way ROI processing
   . locking and buffers, open()->'r' and open_preview()->'', dt is a huge spinlock
   . debuging with -d cache and -d control and tools/create_control_svg.sh

- reimport doesn't remove stale db handles anymore?

- gtk size groups for some modules (alignment in dr mode?)

- image_cache sometimes not initing images (wrong old thumbs etc)

- crop rotate messed up when first rotating and then cropping
  mipf scaled wrong in dr mode when cropped?

- inotify not working? or not re-reading rotation of images in lt mode

- lighttable:
  - lower bound not just one row of images in sight, but max 1 row of empty images.

- tiff import broken?

- lists: library/collection: height to multiple of baselineskip

- BUG: full image not loaded due to 1st buffer > mem limit

- more sophisticated auto complete in preset creation
- colorin default: read input color profile from ldr images

- ctrl-z ctrl-shift-z up/down in history stack


- translatable darkroom mode plugin template
- spot brushes?

- fine-grained history stack copying/replacing:
  - copy history stack augmented by list of favorite image styles
  - simple interface to [de-]activate single operations, or
    replace them with presets from the list instead.

- tiff/png input
- remove lensfun add crop autocrop

- denoise with too small values crashes (for hdr input).
- denoise preset/max values meaningless for hdr input

- snapshots: side-by-side mode/split along different axes, etc..
- steal gegl tonemapping operators?
- port input imageio to plugins?
- stars: possibility to filter by exact number, not >=
- filmstrip h/v/match/off
- backup tables: presets, color labels

- annoying coarse pixels when we have to wait anyways, and no moving took place.
- mipf not loaded on time in develop for small displays.

- read additional tags from exif
- mouse wheel zoom in navigation
- splines: linear interpolation check box
- decapitalize icc profile names
- lock zoom/pan checkbox in darkroom mode
- lensfun + crop: preview/full image differ in zoom/pan?
- remember visible image/center image for each film and mode
- thumbnail regeneration trigger: expose after image loaded not enough?
- compare sha1sum in db with image on open.
- whitebalance finetune presets: interpolate if not all in wb_presets.c
- gimp code: optimized jpeg + gui for export
- save custom defaults (sqlite table iop_defaults) to external file as well
- gnome-color-manager dbus interaction
- views/browse.c: browse by similar tag:
  inner 1:1 lighttable image, border with smaller images with
  related tags, 2*k+2 many.
- browse clusters of images by
  - extract image statistics/compare metric
  - faces (opencv), hist L, hist wtf, hist (a,b)
  - select (random?) representative
- lighttable side-by-side mode
- embedded thumbnail as static snapshot
- closeup in 3:1 5:1 or 2:1 ?
- keep stdout clean! (shut up exiv2 and jpg)
- copy function in lib:
  - flags, tags
- bzip2 compressed content
- offline media reference in db
