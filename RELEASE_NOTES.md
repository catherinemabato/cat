## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.0. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- ???

## UI/UX Improvements

- Added camera-specific styles for more than 500 camera models to more
  closely approximate the out-of-camera JPEG rendition.  These styles
  only affect contrast, brightness, and saturation and do not attempt
  to match sharpening, denoising, or hue shifts.  Also added a LUA
  script to auto-apply the appropriate style on import and manually
  apply styles to a collection of previously-imported images.

- The user interface now gives feedback while processing bulk image
  operations such as ratings, tagging, and edit history management,
  rather than silently freezing until the operation completes.  While
  the operation is in progress, darktable will now show either a busy
  cursor (such as a stopwatch or spinner) or a progress bar with
  option to cancel the remainder of the operation.

- Added a high-contrast theme with bright white text on a dark gray
  background.

- Enhanced tooltips for utiltity module headers to provide more
  information about the module.

- Added two new error placeholder images to distinguish between
  missing, unsupported, and corrupted images.  When attempting to edit
  such an image, an appropriate, more specific error message is
  displayed.

- When selecting a style in the export module, hovering on the style
  name in the popup menu displays a thumbnail previewing the effect of
  appending the style to the active image's edit (first selected image
  in lighttable, center-view image in darkroom).

## Performance Improvements

- Improved the speed of bulk image operations by improving the speed
  of sidecar writes, and by moving sidecar updates for many operations
  into a background task, allowing the user to proceed before the
  writes complete.

## Other Changes

- Switched default scope for new installations from histogram to
  waveform to display more detailed information about image color and
  tonality.

- The ISO 12646 color assessment condition is kept until unset by user
  action.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a performance regression for redrawing mipmaps.

## Lua

### API Version

- API version is now 9.3.0

### Bug Fixes

### Add action support for Lua

### Other Lua changes


## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export module's preference options.

- Release 4.8 drops support for macOS versions older than 13.5.
