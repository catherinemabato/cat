We're proud to announce the new bug fix release of darktable, 4.2.1!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-4.2.1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-4.2.1).

As always, please don't use the autogenerated tarball provided by
github, but only our tar.xz file. The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1.tar.xz
??? darktable-4.2.1.tar.xz
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1.dmg
??? darktable-4.2.1.dmg
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1-win64.exe
??? darktable-4.2.1-win64.exe
```

When updating from the stable 4.0.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.0.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

## The Big Ones


## Other Changes

- JPEG files are identified using magic bytes instead of file
  extension. This helps in cases where JPEG images end up in
  files with unexpected extensions.

- Allow shortcuts to be assigned to the "quick access" style and preset
  menus at the bottom of the darkroom view

- Add a collapsible section to the sigmoid module so that
  controls not used in standard processing scenarios are hidden
  by default.

- Some minor modifications to image overlays in culling view to make
  them less intrusive.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix possible bad pinned memory transfer on OpenCL.

- Fix bug in date/time sanitization function that caused image capture
  timestamps to be corrupted when they contained a time zone with a
  negative offset.

- Fix toast messages containing "%".

- Fix collections module using exclude rules when the first filter is empty.

- Fix RGB curve histogram display when "compensate middle gray" is set.

- Fix possible infinite loop when a module fails to load.

- Properly honor "hide histogram" setting when restarting.

- Fix darktable-chart crash.

- Fix Y0 mask calculations in the demosaic module.

- Avoid using fscanf() for loading configuration to avoid broken Windows
  implementation.

- Add RYB vectorscope option to the darktable configuration file to
  ensure proper histogram view settings on startup.

- Ensure that wide popups are properly shown on the same display as
  the associated widget.

- Fix possible crash in camera tethering.

- Make yes/no buttons in dialog boxes respond to standard shortcuts alt+y
  and alt+n.

- Fix preferences sanitization, which was completely ineffective due to
  incorrect loading order.

- Add a link to the sigmoid module's online documentation.

- Fix tooltip on color calibration expander.

- Fix incorrect reporting of HEIF image bit depth, which resulted in
  incorrect color profile selection for images without embedded color
  profile data.

- Fix snapshot invalidation, which was too pessimistic and made
  switching snapshots slow.

- Fix some messages in LUT module.
