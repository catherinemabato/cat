## The Big Ones

- A full rewrite of the lighttable has been done. This gives again a
  big performance jump and will allow smooth interaction for any
  screen resolution. At the same time the filmstrip has been reworked.

  It is important to note that this speed improvement is really
  noticeable in the zoomable lighttable view.

  The culling view has also been rewritten from scratch.

  Some other parts have been reworked like the Color Picker or
  Location modules to better fit into the new UI and most of the icons
  to be more visually balanced.

  This new lighttable version should be prepared for 8K screen resolution.

  There is many overlay kind possible on thumbs. Different overlay
  information can be selected depending on the thumb size on the
  lighttable. The different sizes can be set in the preferences. So we
  can have no overlay at all for small thumbs and full overlay when
  large thumbs are displayed. This is fully configurable.

  Likewise, the tooltip information when hovering the thumbs can be
  activated/deactivated based on the thumbs size.

- A complete overhaul of the CSS has also been done. This gives
  darktable a very professional look at this time. This also continues
  the goal to make every single aspect of the UI themable using CSS.

- Also the lighttable has been made more visually living by
  highlighting the buttons only when the context makes the action
  possible. This give a better user experience.

- The preference dialog has been fully reviewed and reorganized to
  propose a better look and at the same time requiring less
  scrolling. It is also possible to add some CSS rules directly into
  the preference dialog to tweak darktable's look. It is also possible
  to directly control the font size and DPI values from the general
  preference tab.

  Also a search field on shortcuts tab has been added to help you find
  shortcut you want to customize.

- The new module negadoctor has been added to help inverting negative
  films.

- A new histogram display called RGB Parade has been added. At the
  same time the histogram module height can now be adjusted.

- The metadata feature has been turned generic internally and has got new
  features. The user can now select the information he wants to see in the
  metadata editor. This selection is automatically mirrored in collection
  and image information modules.

  Along with a new "notes" field, all the fields are multiline
  <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd>, sizable <kbd>Ctrl+Scroll</kbd> and can be set
  as private (not exported). Metadata collection filters have an entry
  "not defined". At import time it is possible to avoid to import
  some metadata.

- Image change detection has been made more reliable. This affects
  lighttable thumbnails change symbol and history collection filter
  which should now be accurate.

  In darkroom navigation, this avoids to recalculate an image and save
  the xmp file when there is no change.

- A new down-sampling preference has been introduced for faster
  response in darkroom. The preview is either computed at full
  resolution (original, default value) or at 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 of the
  original size. This allow for better performance but can slightly
  hinder the precision of the guided filter masking.

  Note that this is a very delicate area to implement. Lot of care have
  been done to ensure all is correct when using down sampling. It
  touches all areas of darktable like masks, guided filter, liquify
  controls, crop & rotate, lens and perspective corrections...

- Clarify the two possible work flows. We had a preference for
  applying or not the base curve. Many questions was raised about the
  intention. The new preference introduce tow work-flow:

  display-referred : use base-curve

  scene-referred   : use filmic and exposure compensation (new default)

- Filmic RGB goes to v4 with highlight recovery integrated.

## New Features And Changes

- Add support for curved gradients. The gradient mask can now be
  curved to revert fish-eye kind distortion and so become a straight
  line on the horizon for example. This can also be used to artistic
  goals.

- Add support for AVIF file format (>= 0.7)

- Collect module has two new filters: module and module order.

  The former make it possible to filter pictures based on the
  activated modules in the history. The later can be used to filter
  based on the pipe version (legacy up to 2.6 releases or v3.0
  starting with 3.0 release).

- A full rewrite of the pipe ordering has been done. It is now
  possible to change the order of the pipe using a new module giving
  access to the legacy order (order used up to 2.6 releases) and the
  v3.0 order introduced with darktable 3.0 on Dec 2019. It is also
  possible to create order presets which can be freely applied.

  Note that the copy / paste of multi-instances when they have been
  reordered in a way that some other modules are separating them will
  not keep the same order. This was buggy in previous implementation
  when the target image had also been reordered in a non compatible
  manner or using a different pipe order. In this new versions all the
  multi-instances will be grouped together keeping their relative
  order.

  Note that this work has mainly been done to make the implementation
  simpler, safer and that will require less maintenance. Also as this
  implementation records the full pipe order for history and styles it
  will be the ground for proposing different strategies when applying
  styles.

- The retouch module has a new accel "show or hide shapes" which can
  be mapped to a key for quickly show or hide shapes. This comes in
  addition to the right-click on the image which does the same action.

- The spot removal module accel to show-hide shapes has been renamed
  to "show or hide shapes" for clarity and to be consistent with
  the new accel in the retouch module.

- It is possible to change the color of all overlays (shapes, guides,
  etc), in darkroom. This may come handy on some images where the gray
  guides where barely visible. The possible colors are now : Grey,
  Red, Green, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta. The colors can be cycled through
  using the <kdb>Ctrl+O</kdb> key.

- In crop & rotate module, the pan movements can be restricted
  vertically or horizontally using the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or
  <kbd>Control</kbd> respectively.

- The crop & rotate module now allows format ratios to be entered as
  a float number.

- When using a snapshot view, a flag to clearly show the position of the
  snapshot has been added.

- Improve the falloff and radius of the vignette to 200% for better
  control.

- Add a user-defined mode in the white-balance module to keep the last
  modification of the module. It is then possible to go back to the
  last modified setting after selecting another mode like spot for
  example.

- Dynamic accelerators have been added for combo-boxes making it
  possible to select next and previous values directly from the
  keyboard.

- It is now possible to adjust the color picker areas just after
  having created them. This is achieved by dragging one of the four
  little square handles at the corner.

- Tagging improvements. Entry tag(s) creation works now without image
  selected.  It is allowed to create a tag on virtual node, to insert
  a pipe <kbd>|</kbd> character in create tag (menu). The tree display
  shows the newly created tags.

- New variables $(LENS), $(EXIF_EXPOSURE_BIAS), $(VERSION_NAME) and
  $(VERSION_IF_MULTI) have been defined. $(CATEGORYn(category)) works
  now when multiple values on the same image (for example people) and
  accepts 9 levels instead of 3 (for n).

- Four new timestamps are now supported to store the import, last
  export, last change and last print times. Those timestamps are also
  made available in the collection module and so can be used to better
  control of created collections.

- Multiple images drag & drop works now on map view.

- Add a new preference for keyboard shortcuts for selecting the way
  multi-instances are handled (use first or last instance, use the
  visible, active or unfolded instance).

- An introspection support has been added into darktable. At this time
  this does not bring new features for end-users but it has provided a
  ground for a big simplification of the code. This will provide easier
  integration of new modules and will ensure better interactivity
  consistency between modules.

- Add optional grey-scale export of TIFF for monochrome images.

- Add some tooltip information for tone equalizer.

- Some actions like cropping are more responsive by triggering a
  fast-pipe mode where the quality of the image may be less accurate
  while dragging the controls.

- Better support for HiDPI icons theme on Windows.

- Add keyboard shortcut for enabling/disabling tooltips.

- Better history stack module order (more logical).

- Add confirmation when deleting/updating presets.

- It is possible to handle (deleting, applying or exporting) multiple
  styles in the style module.

- Rework the sliders to make then look better (smaller and controls a
  bit more visible).

- Implement undo/redo for the orientation changes from the lighttable.

- Exported pictures size should be more conservative and stable when
  flip or orientation is changed.

- Using <kdb>Ctrl+Click</kbd> in blending module it is possible to
  allow continuous creation of masks.

  This was the default in liquify module, for consistency this has
  been changed and so now one need to use <kdb>Ctrl+Click</kbd> in
  liquify for continuous mask creation.

- Rejecting an image still keeps the last number of starts. So
  un-rejecting it will recover the previous notes.

- Improve messages when a database lock is detected to give better
  guidance about the possible solutions, checks to be done for
  recovering from this situation.

- Rework local laplacian implementation for a 2x speed-up.

- Optimize the denoise profile module (bilateral filter) for better
  performances.

- Many part of the histogram code has been reworked for better
  performances.

- A new universal toast message framework has been put in place. This
  is used to display information about changes done with dynamic keys
  when the module is collapsed. It gives visual information about the
  change being done (like exposure change or new opacity value, etc.).

- The spot removal module has been enhanced to better fit with other
  modules. A new button has been added to show/hide shapes. It also
  supports continuous shape creation.

- Applying a style now support the overwrite mode (it was always
  appending to the current modules). This makes the style module
  consistent with the copy/paste of history.

- Add a new keyboard shortcut to toggle last snapshot on/off.

- Add a new keyboard shortcut to show/hide lib modules.

- Allow for more than 500 images in tethered control which is needed
  for time-lapse.

- It is now possible to export masks in TIFF format.

- Fix support of legacy parameters in the basic adjustment module.

- Add integrated database maintenance policy.

## Bug fixes

- Better performance when using masks.

- Fix some displayed images issues.

- Fix exporting private tags issue with different settings along the path.

- Fix possible freeze on liquify module.

- Fix long text display when no place to show all by ellipsize them.

- Fix some crop & rotate issues.

- Smoother transition for gradient shapes.

- Fix the snapshot rotation which could go 180Â° in a single click.

- Add missing icon for the tone-mapping module.

- Fix color-zone module min & max indicator in edit by area mode.

- Enhance performance of blending and retouch, tone equalizer,
  color-picker modules when masks are set on/off and/or removing some
  unnecessary reprocessing.

- Fix displayed curve in denoise profile Y0U0V0 mode.

- Film rolls can be ordered by folder name or id (so in chronological
  order).

- Fix gphoto camera detection procedure.

- Fix the opacity (a second attempt) issue which could go wrong and
  let thinking that a mask had no effect.

- Fix a possible infinite loop in the slide show module.

- Fix a possible out-of-bound indexing in the chromatic aberration module.

- Fix issues when importing duplicates.

- Fix possible race condition in tone equalizer module.

## Notes

- The histogram has been deactivated on the print view because after
  lot of work on the histogram code it was not possible to have it
  ready for this view. The work on this part is almost ready now so
  the print view will get back its histogram for the 3.4 release.

- An integration test suite has been added. This will ensure better
  quality and keeping old edits intact. This is an important tool for
  developers to ensure a rework of a module for performance reason
  for example does not change visually the image.

## Lua

- API changed to 6.0.0

- facebook, flickr, and picasa removed from types.dt_imageio_storage_module_t.

  to set the width of the  left or right panels and the height of the bottom panel.

- fixed is_password field of entry widget to work according to the API manual, so
  now when it is set to true the field is hidden.

- Added function darktable.gui.views.lighttable.is_image_visible to check if an image
  is visible in lighttable view.
