Rating, color labels, geo-tagging and selected status on Lightroom are only
on the SQLite database and not exported into the XMP sidecar.

To synchronize those settings from Lightroom into darktable here are two
helper scripts.

1. get_lr_data.sh

   To be run once, the parameter is the SQLite Lightroom catalog.

   This script will create $HOME/.config/darktable/lr.db

2. sync_dt.sh

   Do not take any parameter, this script will synchronize the rating,
   color labels and selected status from lr.db to darktable's library.db.

   It must be run after importing some images that have been edited with
   Lightroom. It will get the data for the new images.

   Note that you'll probably need to edit this script to add the proper
   color label name for your country. Currently only English and French
   are supported. Feel free to contribute patches.

   To get all the names, run the following on the console (after
   get_lr_data.sh has been runned):

   echo "SELECT DISTINCT (colorLabels) from data;" | sqlite3 ~/.config/darktable/lr.db
