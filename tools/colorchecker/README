this little utility creates darktable presets for
picture styles for the colorchecker lut module and the tonecurve.

you can match colors give raw and jpg pairs or an absolute
it8 chart reference.

input is a .csv file with the following format:
[string] [float] [float] [float] [float] [float] [float]
<patch name> <source L> <source a> <source b> <target L> <target a> <target b>

the last N patches will be assumed to represent the gray ramp (6 for the color
checker and 24 for the it8 chart)

internally, orthogonal matching pursuit is used to find a sparse set of
these source/target pairs to best match the overall output. these will be
presented in the gui.
